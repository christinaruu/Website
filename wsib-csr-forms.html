        <h3><b>Overview</b> – Interactive forms to streamline customer service process</h3>
        <h3><b>Role</b> – Main designer along with 1 other designer and 1 developer </h3>
        <h3><b>Tools</b> – Invision</h3>

        <h1 class="padding-50">Context</h1>
        <p>Templates/forms are used at a Call Center to document information for further processing in order to close the case. Oftentimes, information is recorded in these templates during a call. Currently, these templates are difficult to navigate, fill, and export. The Lab has been tasked to help with the redesign of the process and templates. 
        </p>

        <h1 class="padding-50">Goal</h1>
        <p>To streamline the template process and design at a call center. 
        </p>

        <h1 class="padding-50">Target Users</h1>
        <p>
            Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) at the call center
        </p>

        </div>

    <div class="container-proj">
        <h1 class="padding-50">Research</h1>
        <p>Before the design stage, it was critical to fully understand the template process. To do this, we met with the Call Center team and many of their CSRs to understand the procedures, terminologies, and pain points. Job shadowing and user interviews were conducted. From the information we obtained, journey maps and user personas were created of both the CSR and the caller. 

            <br><br> During our job shadowing, it was also mentioned that the completed templates were difficult to draw information from. User interviews were also conducted with employees that use the exported templates, aside from the CSRs. </p>

        <h3 class="padding-30">Pain Points</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excessive number of templates to learn and switch between </li>
                <li>Vague questions and scripts  </li>
                <li>Unclear and confusing instructions for templates  </li>
                <li>Inefficient and slow exporting process   </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 class="padding-30">Wants and Needs</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved flow and order of questions; template flow to match typical call flow </li>
                <li>Better exporting method </li>
                <li>Reduce redundant and unnecessary questions </li>
                <li>Pop up instructions during use of template  </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h1 class="padding-50">Proposed Design</h1>

        <p>
            Previous versions of the design cannot be displayed due to workplace confidentiality. 
            
            <br><br> It was important for the design to be clean, clear, and easily to navigate. Content was more spread out so that it is less overwhelming for the user. Each question would appear one at a time so that the user knows exactly where they are. This also allows the next question to be generated based on the previous answer, reducing the number of templates needed. 
            
            <br><br> There are information icons everywhere in case the user needs help on the spot. There are also small commands throughout the template for the user to easily follow. 
            
            <br><br> During the user research stage, it was seen that most CSRs use a personal checklist after each call, so we thought it was fitting to include one at the end of each template. 
        </p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="container-proj">
        <p><br> Since the filled out templates are then passed to other CSRs down the line, it was important to present the information in an easily digestible fashion. The exported templates would not look the same as when they are being filled out. <br> <br> </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-proj">
        <h1 class="padding-50">Results</h1>
        <p>
            A great deal of the user research has been completed but there is still much to be done. The Call Center is satisfied with the look and feel of the design and user flows. Development has begun but is not completed. This project will continue with the next group of co-op students. 
            
            <br><br>Update: The project is completed and showed a lot of positive impact to the business. A product solution is now being developed.
