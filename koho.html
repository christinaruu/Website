        <h2 class="padding-50">deCODE Hackathon with KOHO </h2>
        <h3><b>Overview</b> – Donation feature on KOHO mobile app </h3>
        <h3><b>Role</b> – Designer along with 2 other designers and 8 developers  </h3>
        <h3><b>Tools</b> – Figma, Miro </h3>

        <h1 class="padding-50">Context</h1>
        <p>
        In March 2021, I attended the deCODE hackathon and was paired with KOHO, along with five other students. We were given less than two days to design and develop a fully functioning feature that would integrate with KOHO’s existing platform. It was a lot to take on, but thankfully there were three full timers from KOHO (one designer and two developers) to mentor us! 

        <br> <br>KOHO creates financial products that are open, intuitive, and designed to help users live a better life. One of their key features is something called RoundUps, where every transaction is rounded up to the nearest $1, $5, or $10, and the extra money is added to a pool. Overtime, this pool accumulates more and more and you can use it as savings money. See more about this cool feature here. 
        
        <br> <br>KOHO approached us with the idea to implement some sort of donation feature into their mobile app. There were many routes that we could explore in regards to donations, but we wanted to choose a path that was feasible in the limited timeframe. 
        </p>

        <h1 class="padding-50">Goal</h1>
        <p>To implement a donation feature into the existing KOHO mobile application that would allow users to search for charities, set donation goals, and continuously add to these goals from their RoundUps.</p>
    </div>

        <div class="container-med">

        <div class="container-proj">
        <h1 class="padding-50">Target Users</h1>
        <p>
            Due to the short timeframe, we were unable to conduct proper user research and testing. Instead, we tried to gather as many opinions and thoughts from the team. 

            <br> <br>The target audience for this feature would be existing KOHO users. 
        </p>

        <h1 class="padding-50">Next Steps</h1>
        <p>
             If I were to take this project even further, I would implement the following features: 
             <ul>
                <li>
                    Allowing user to set more than one donation goal at a time
                </li>
                <li>
                    Providing the option to start a social campaign where groups of friends can contribute to the same donation goal
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allowing the user to immediately donate if they have enough money in their RoundUps pool
                </li>
                <li>
                    Filtering charities by location, interest, popularity, type, etc. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h1 class="padding-50">Conclusions</h1>
        <p>
            deCODE was my very first hackathon and partnering with KOHO made it even more special. Being able to work alongside KOHO was a great opportunity and I was able to learn and gather so much valuable feedback. 
            
            <br><br> Overall, I am very thankful for this experience and was able to meet some new people. The design iterations and mindset that we had can be seen in our final product. I can definitely see myself bringing what I’ve learned into my future career.
