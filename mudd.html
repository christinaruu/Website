        <h3><b>Company</b> – LCBO|Next </h3>
        <h3><b>Role</b> – Product designer along with one product manager and two full-stack developers </h3>
        <h3><b>Tools</b> – Figma </h3>
        <h3><b>Year</b> – 2021 </h3>

        <h1 class="padding-50">Background</h1>
        <h3 class="padding-30">What is LCBO|next?</h3>
        <p>The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) is a Canadian Crown corporation that is responsible for selling and distributing alcoholic beverages across Ontario. With more than 660 retail stores and 450 vendors, the LCBO’s quasi-monopoly status in Canada’s most populous province has made it the world’s largest purchaser of alcoholic beverages. With a lot at stake, the LCBO is dedicated to managing and delivering remarkable experiences to Ontarians for the world’s wines, beers, and spirits. 

            <br><br> To stay competitive and avoid complacency despite a quasi-monopoly status, the LCBO kickstarted a new initiative with LCBO|next based out of Communitech, a Waterloo innovation hub. As the innovation lab, it’s responsible for exploring new technologies and enhancing the LCBO’s technology initiatives to solve the unique problems customers or business partners face. This means bringing fresh ideas, creative thinking, and new skills to the table and constantly learning on a day-to-day basis. With the resources of a large company and the culture and energy of a start-up, the LCBO|next lab produces ideas that have lasting impacts on the LCBO’s operations and customer experience across the province. 
            
            <br><br> Co-op students are always encouraged to seek and discover new initiatives that can be tackled and one of the ideas that I came up with was tackling the problem of the lab’s efficient process for tracking and remediating bugs. This was a brand-new idea with nothing completed by previous students, so it was important to dive right into research. 
            </p>

        <h3 class="padding-30">Responsible Service Program</h3>
        <p>Selling alcohol responsibly is a public trust. As a Crown corporation, the LCBO is committed to prioritizing the health and well-being of Ontarians and ensuring that employees, customers, and communities are safe from harm. This is currently being mandated under the Responsible Service Program. Trained LCBO retail employees are required to refuse service to those who appear 30 or younger and fail to produce valid ID, appear intoxicated, or attempt to purchase for a minor or an impaired individual. In 2018-2019, LCBO staff challenged more than 13.1 million individuals for the above criteria, and service was refused to nearly 242,000 people with 82% for reasons of age. 
        </p>

        <h1 class="padding-50">
            There is a higher likelihood of attempts to purchase alcoholic beverages while underage near social events such as prom or graduation.
        </h1>

        <p><br>This increased illegal store traffic results in LCBO store managers frequently asking high schools in the area for dates of upcoming dances, graduations, and other occasions when students and graduates might try to obtain alcohol. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="padding-30">Project Idea</h3>
        <p>We first listed out a few of our assumptions: 
            <ul>
                <li>Key users of our product would be LCBO store managers and high school administrative staff. 
                </li>
                <li>LCBO store managers would want the ability to holistically receive, view, and plan for social events to heighten awareness and ultimately ensure that the frequency of underage drinking diminished.   </li>
                <li>LCBO store managers would want an easy-to-use and easily accessible method of communication between themselves and the high schools to thus encourage more frequent and more productive conversations. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            We also predicted some key actions that users would want the ability to do, such as social event reporting, editing social event details, allowing LCBO staff to track dates of events, and notifying LCBO staff of upcoming events. 

            <br><br>Before we started talking to people about the project idea, we first needed a name for it. We wanted the name to be something iconic that people could easily remember, and what could be more iconic than MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving), which already happened to be partnered with the LCBO as part of the Responsible Service Program. Thus, we arrived at a name for our project - Making Underage Drinking Decrease, or MUDD, as a kind of homage. 
            
        </p>

        <h3 class="padding-30">Constraints</h3>
        <p>Time 
            <br>Since this project was occurring during a co-op work term, we faced the ever-present constraint of time. Being confined to a four-month work term, we were determined to at least get a bronze phase of the project out the door before the term ended so that the new co-op students could pick up the project in an easily comprehensible state. 
            
            <br><br>Work From Home
            <br>Another constraint was that our team was kept within the confines of our own homes, as millions of others were during the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant we couldn’t conduct in-person user interviews, usability tests, or concierge tests, which could have provided us with some invaluable insights. Hosting these sessions remotely may have also influenced the transparency or accuracy of our results/findings, but we had to make the most of the cards we were dealt. 
            </p>

        <h1 class="padding-50">User/Market Research </h1>
        <h3 class="padding-30">User interviews</h3>
        <p>
            We had a general idea of who we should be reaching out to, but who better to contact first than the LCBO’s Director of Retail Operations? After getting in contact with the Director of Retail Operations and being given helpful tips on who and how to contact some of our key stakeholders, we started our process of user interviews. 

            <br><br>For this project, interviews were conducted with LCBO store managers from store locations throughout the province. The high-level goal was to learn how current store managers addressed the problem of underage drinking and what processes they already had in place to mitigate underage drinking.

            <br><br>It is important to note for the following interviews, we asked open-ended questions and when relevant, prompted interviewees to delve deeper into their answers by asking questions such as, “Why did you do X?” or “Could you please elaborate on that?”. If needed, these prompts were asked multiple times to try and uncover the root cause of an issue. 

        </p>

        <h3 class="padding-30">LCBO Store Managers</h3>
        <p>
            When reaching out to the store managers, we ideally didn’t want the stores they managed to be too close to each other. This was so that we could gain insights from different communities that could potentially have different workflows depending on the region’s demographic or community culture. We also targeted stores that were actually near high schools so that we could have a productive and relevant conversation. 

            <br><br> Conclusions
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some store managers contact local high schools to be notified of upcoming social events to heighten security during these times. Other store managers find out about events through word of mouth or searching on the high school websites or do not actively look for events at all.
            </li>
            <li>Contacting high school staff for these events could be considered ‘crossing the line’ for store managers.
            </li>
            <li>After knowing of social events, the manager will notify their team of the event dates during a team huddle.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Goals and pain points</p>
        <ul>
            <li>LCBO store owners want to know and track a list of dates for social events simply and painlessly.
            </li>
            <li>LCBO staff want to know how far in advance they should be heightening their security to ensure maximal prevention.
            </li>
            <li>LCBO store owners want to clear their email inboxes from clutter and have all required information in one place.
            </li>
            <li>
                Store owners are typically preoccupied with varying tasks throughout their workday, so any simplification in their email inbox would be appreciated.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="padding-30">High School Administrative Staff</h3>
        <p>
            When reaching out to high school administrative staff, similar to before, we ideally wanted to reach out to high schools across the province so that we could gain insights from different communities. These high schools would also need to be near LCBO locations so that relevant questions could be asked.
            <br><br> Conclusions</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some high school administrative staff were contacted by LCBO store managers. They cooperated and provided as much detail as they could without putting any students at risk. 
            </li>
            <li>All confirmed school events are logged into a master calendar of events. Events that are definitely going to occur but have not yet been scheduled, are not added to the calendar.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Goals and pain points</p>
        <ul>
        <li>High school administrative staff want to ensure the safety and health of their students.
        </li>
        <li>High school administrative staff need to be cognizant of how much data they are sharing, how they are sharing it, and who they are sharing it with. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="padding-30">User Personas</h3>
        <p>After conducting 10 user interviews, we compiled all our notes and conclusions and created two distinct personas. The personas below are simplified versions of the personas we had developed.  
        </p> <br>

    </div>

    <div class="container-proj">
        <h3 class="padding-30">Customer Journey</h3>
        <p>Using a combination of the newly-made personas and the insights we gained from the user interviews, we were able to visualize a typical customer journey and create a journey map. Typically, this would've also been supplemented with findings from an in-person concierge test, but with the ongoing pandemic, we had to make do with what we had. </p> <br>

    <div class="container-proj">
        <h1 class="padding-30">Design</h1>
        <p>
            To ensure internal team alignment, I first put together a low-fidelity prototype and walked through it with our team before moving on to a more sophisticated design. For good measure, we also ran through the low-fidelity prototypes with some helpfully willing potential users. At the lab, we manifested a user-first culture where we would involve our users as frequently as possible, to ensure that we build the right thing. We recognized that user demands can change with time and more information, so we never hesitated to invite people to get a sneak peek and show improved iterations of our designs and user flow. This worked in our favour as well since we would constantly be receiving feedback and fine-tuning our product. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="padding-30">User Flow</h3>
        <p>
            There are two users for this project; LCBO store managers and high school administrative staff. The goal is for store managers to be up-to-date and fully aware of when upcoming social events occur. It is up to the high school admin to provide this information to nearby LCBO stores. In addition to store managers reaching out to high school admins through publicly available contact information, to ease the information retrieval process, it was decided that high school admins would be given access to the portal through their school credentials. 

            <br> <br>By giving high school admins access to the portal, it allows them to not only proactively input information and eliminate the need for store managers to reach out, but it also allows for the convenient updating of information when event details change. The result would be an online calendar that can be subscribed to by LCBO store managers via existing tools such as Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar. By being subscribed to this calendar, all social events of schools within a specified region would appear in a manager’s view and be updated live. 

            <br> <br>The MVP portal was decided to only include an interface for the high school admin side.  In addition to the ability to add event details, the interface includes contact details for nearby LCBO stores if a high school admin ever finds the need to contact the LCBO about a problem or specific event.

            <br> <br>It was also understood that not all social events occurred at the corresponding high school itself. For example, prom is often held at a banquet hall outside of the high school and possibly much farther away. Because of this, details for this event would be sent to all LCBOs near the high school and the location of the banquet hall.

            <br> <br>With this design, LCBO store managers can rest assured knowing the information they have is up-to-date and that there is no need to contact or follow up with high schools or search online for social events. The time previously spent doing these tasks can be put toward more productive things such as tightening security within stores or promoting more responsible drinking.

            <br> <br>It is also possible to include another high school in the description for events that involve multiple schools. This kind of event would notify LCBO stores near all participating schools.<br> <br>

    <div class="container-proj">
        <h3 class="padding-30">Calendar Logic</h3>
        <p>
            You may be wondering how we would populate the distance-dependent event information in an online calendar per LCBO store. Well, this section is just for you. If you’re not interested in the high-level logic of how we were planning on accomplishing the backend logic, feel free to skip ahead. 

            <br><br> First, we would need a database of all the high schools and LCBO stores in Ontario and their respective addresses. If a high school and a store were within a reasonable distance, we would then call the Google Maps API to calculate the driving distance between the two points. The aspect of reasonable distance is important to note as we wanted to avoid any unnecessary processing time. Whether or not two locations are within a reasonable distance would be determined either through the provincial postal code logic or by fetching and comparing against the neighbouring regions of a given town/city. 

            <br><br> After mapping LCBO stores to their respective high schools, we could then simply create an online calendar for every high school and every LCBO store. An LCBO store’s calendar would then subscribe to every relevant high school’s calendar to have all the events in view. An LCBO store manager would then subscribe to their respective LCBO store’s calendar.

            Overall, my experience at the LCBO Innovation Lab was beyong valuable. In four short months, I was fortunate enough to learn about and lead the product design process. Through this, I truly believe I found my strive as a product designer and developed confidence in my abilities. I was fortunate enough to have an amazing supervisor in Danny Ho, the Director of Innovation, who supported me the whole way and was always open to answer any questions that I had.
